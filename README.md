### It's time to LOCK IN!! A simple yet expansive todo list website.
Ok, cool! What does it do?
- My Tasks page to view all tasks, which come with the usual stuff: name, description, duedate, and I also added priorities and labels, Todoist-style. (I like todoist ok)
- Upcoming Tasks page to see everything for the next week, this time in a Board format
- Ability to add new tasks / modify existing tasks
- Looks decent too

### Note: This project is half-finished!
Well, not really. I kinda lost passion to finish this completely, so what's here is everything I've done so far.
Stuff the final project should have:
- A complete Labels Page, right now the current one is a little broken. Styling's a bit off and theres no functionaility to add/delete labels
- History page which gives a log of tasks you added and deleted
- Ability to add projects, think of a My Tasks clone for specialised work
- A page to view such projects
- Local storage of tasks and other data so stuff stays even when you close the site

schools busy ok, I'll maybe revisit this in the future, see how lol
